# World of Darkness 5e Developers

This is an organization comprising of the people who actively create and maintain the [World of Darkness 5e system](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/vtm5e/) on [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/).

We make sure that people can enjoy playing the World of Darkness 5e systems in Foundry. Currently, we provide support for:
* Vampire the Masquerade 5th Edition
* Hunter the Reckoning 5th Edition
* Werewolf the Apocalypse 5th Edition

With hopes to support any future 5th edition World of Darkness systems, as well!
